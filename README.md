Open Source Homework Website

This was a project I worked on for a friend over the summer. I worked on this project concurently with my Logicboard project (also on my github). 
I forked this project over to my personal github for personal recording of open source projects I worked on. This is a closed project and is more
of an archive of old work I have done in the past. As you can tell the PHP code work I did was quite redundant and procedural, however this project 
did help me learn how to code php as well as introduce me to full stack development. It was a very fun project and had a great time working on it with 
a close friend. Great learning experience and great times! + Caffeine. 

<b>NOTE: I did most of the development work on this project, mostly because Mark was working over the summer and didn't have much time to work on it! However, since I forked this project for records, it will apear as though I have contriubuted little to nothing!</b>
